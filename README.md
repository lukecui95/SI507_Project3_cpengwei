# Project 3 - SQLAlchemy database in Flask - Pengwei Cui

In this project, I write a small Flask application that includes a database to hold data about movies. 

My movie database contains four tables and my Flash application has four routes. Each of those routes has some specific uses.

All my codes are included in file SI507_project3.py.
